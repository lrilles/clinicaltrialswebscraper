Open up terminal/command prompt app

 

Check to make sure Python is installed correctly using “py –version”
Type “py –version” into the command prompt and press enter. If Python has installed correctly, the command prompt will return the version you’re using (in this case it’s 3.9.0)”
 

Open up python to install pytrials
Run “py -m pip install pytrials”
To download pytrials, the web scraper, from the internet, simply type “py -m install pytrials” into the command prompt and press enter. If you don’t get an error of any sort, assume the installation has worked.
